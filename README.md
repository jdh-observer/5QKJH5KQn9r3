The infamous late sixteenth century novel Jinpingmei (Plum in the Golden Vase) is famed for its extensive intertextuality and complex appropriation of earlier cultural material. The pseudonymous author of Jinpingmei spins a masterful and highly pornographic story out of a brief episode from an earlier novel the Water Margin and peppers the adapted narrative with intrusions of material from a dizzying array of external works with seemingly no regard for the boundaries of genre. This complex intertextual landscape has attracted the attention of scholars in the hundreds of years since the novel first began to circulate, but now computational methods enable us to systematically reconstruct the novelâ€™s textual origins. In this paper, I use a two-step methodology to broaden our understanding of this intertextuality. First, I use a method adapted from bio-informatics to compare the novel against a large corpus of premodern literary materials to identify all instances where material in the novel overlaps with other texts. Then I build machine-learning based text classifiers to identify the likely textual origin of each instance, using the intuition that materials endogenous to Jinpingmei will be more stylistically similar to the rest of the novel than external materials (and conversely, that external materials will more greatly resemble the external work than Jinpingmei). Through this piece, I demonstrate the value of machine-aided detection of source material when working with complex textual artifacts like Jinpingmei and comment on the broader applicability of these methods to literary and historical textual artifacts from China.
