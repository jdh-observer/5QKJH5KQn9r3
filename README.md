The infamous late sixteenth century novel _Jinpingmei_ (_Plum in the Golden Vase_) is renowned as one of the greatest novels of the Chinese tradition and is famed for its extensive intertextuality and complex appropriation of earlier cultural material. The pseudonymous author of _Jinpingmei_ spins a masterful and highly pornographic story out of a brief episode from an earlier novel the _Water Margin_ and peppers the adapted narrative with intrusions of material from a dizzying array of external works with seemingly no regard for the boundaries of genre. This complex intertextual landscape has attracted the attention of scholars in the hundreds of years since the novel first began to circulate, but now computational methods enable us to systematically reconstruct the novelâ€™s textual origins. In this paper, I propose a methodology to broaden our understanding of this intertextuality using machine-learning based text classifiers to identify the likely textual origin of each instance of text reuse identified within a digital corpus, using the intuition that materials endogenous to _Jinpingmei_ will be more stylistically similar to the rest of the novel than external materials (and conversely, that external materials will more greatly resemble the external work than _Jinpingmei_). In this piece, I demonstrate the value and pitfalls of machine-aided detection of source material when working with complex textual artifacts like _Jinpingmei_ and comment on the broader applicability of these methods to other literary works from China.
